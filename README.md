# Acoustics
The scripts are used to calculate the activity and density of acoustic communities in two caves in the Republic of the Congo.

The first script, "1.Density Batpass by month and acoustics group", provides the code for analyzing bat density in the Republic of the Congo as well as the code for the graphs presented in the publication.

The second script, "2.Prediction model and graph 090324", provides the code for making predictions on the emergence and entry of cave bats in the Republic of the Congo, as well as the code for the graphs presented in the publication.

The 

The scripts are related to the following publication currently published in the following reference:
